# NutriLens — Personalized Food Health Analyzer

## Overview

NutriLens is a web-based application that analyzes packaged food ingredients and provides personalized health insights based on user conditions. It simplifies complex ingredient lists into clear, actionable decisions.

---

## Problem

* Food labels are difficult for most people to understand
* Harmful ingredients such as excess sugar, sodium, and additives often go unnoticed
* There is no simple system for personalized dietary guidance

---

## Solution

NutriLens uses a rule-based analysis system to evaluate ingredients and generate personalized health recommendations.

---

## How It Works

1. User selects a food item
2. Ingredient data is retrieved
3. The analysis engine processes the ingredients
4. Personalized suggestions are generated

---

## Features (Version 1)

* Predefined food dataset
* Health condition selection:

  * Diabetic
  * High Cholesterol
  * Weight Loss
* Ingredient-level analysis
* Clear and simple output

---

## Tech Stack

* Python
* Flask
* HTML
* CSS

---

## Architecture

User Input → Flask Route → Analysis Engine → Response
